# Budget.Insulation
Insulation is Expensive! As an alternative: buy Polyurethane foam in Bulk quantities, such as 5 gallon buckets. Mix it yourself. Make a mold of exact size you need out of Wood || metal &amp; thin plastic (for easy release) and Pour it yourself! Beats paying prices for Foam Board!
